# React frontend

## Local setup

### Downloads

First you will need to download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). This will include node package manager (npm) which you will then use to install your frontend packages

### Installing packages

To install all of the required packages for the frontend to function, navigate to the /frontend directory and run:

```
npm install
```

This will install all of the packages listed in package.json to the node_modules directory

If the install fails, instead you can try:

```
npm install --force
```

### Local testing

Once the packages are all installed, you can run the react frontend with the following command:

```
npm start
```
